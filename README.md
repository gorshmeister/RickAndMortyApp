***Data sources:***

Data for the ***“Characters”***, ***“Locations”***, ***“Episodes”*** pages must be obtained from the **API**.

***Correction:***

The proposed API provides information page by page – we display only the first page of data.

The third level of pages (a detailed description of the selected element) does not need to be implemented.

The buttons on the main page change color when you click on them.

The design is at the discretion of the contractor, only the general appearance of the application (prototypes) is presented on the screen forms – the main thing is that the functionality corresponds to what is described in this technical task.
